h2. About

shell-fm is a lightweight, console-based player for Last.FM radio streams. It's pretty small (the binary is currently a little smaller than 60K, or 50K when stripped) and it has most features the "official" player has, if not even a few more. Additional features are, for example:

* network interface (control shell-fm remotely)
* autoban (automatically ban all tracks of an artist you don't like)
* bookmark stations (quickly jump to bookmarked stations with a single key)
* ... probably more

h2. Requirements

shell-fm doesn't need much. You definitely need libmad. shell-fm can also use libao for playback (optional).

h2. Installation

It's always recommended to use the latest version from GitHub.

First clone the repository:

bc. $ git clone http://github.com/jkramer/shell-fm/tree/master

Make sure you have the needed libraries to compile (libmad0-dev and libao-dev.) This should do the trick for Ubuntu:

bc. $ sudo apt-get install libmad0-dev libao-dev

Change into the repository directory and compile Shell.FM:

bc. $ cd shell-fm
$ make

Finally, install the binary and the manual as root:

bc. $ su -c "make install"
OR:
$ sudo make install
